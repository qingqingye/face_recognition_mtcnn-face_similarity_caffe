# MTCNN_face_detection_and_alignment

## About

  This is a python/mxnet implementation of [Zhang](https://kpzhang93.github.io/)'s work **<Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks>**. it's fast and accurate,  see [link](https://github.com/kpzhang93/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment). 

  It should have **almost** the same output with the original work,  for mxnet fans and those can't afford matlab :)

## Requirement	  

- opencv 

  ​	I use cv2 for image io and resize(much faster than skimage), the input image's channel is acutally BGR

- mxnet 

  ​	**please update to the newest version, we need 'full' mode in Pooling operation**

Only tested on Linux and Mac

## Test

run:

 ``python main.py`` 

you can change `ctx` to `mx.gpu(0)` for faster detection
